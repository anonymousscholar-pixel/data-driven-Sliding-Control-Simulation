# Instructions to Run the Simulation and Data Generation Script

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   cd your-repository

3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the simulation script to generate the dataset:
   python scripts/simulation_script.py

5. The generated dataset will be saved as 'simulation_data.csv' in the /dataset folder.

6. Use the generated dataset for running the control algorithms described in the manuscript.
